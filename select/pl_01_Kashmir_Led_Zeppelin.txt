Oh let the sun beat down
upon my face
With stars to fill my dream
I am a traveler
of both time and space
To be where I have been
To sit with elders
of a gentle race
This world has seldom seen
They talk of days
for which they sit and wait
When all will be revealed
<♪>
Talk an' song from tongues of
lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
But not a word I heard could
I relate
The story was quite clear
Whoa-ohh-oh
Whoa-ohhh-oh-oh
<♪>
Ooooh
Oh baby I've been flyin'
Nooo-yeah
Oh mama there
Ain't no denyin'
Oh Ooooh-yes
I've been flyin'
Ma-ma-ma
Ain't no denyin'
No denyin'-uh
<♪>
Oh
All I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Tryin' to find
Tryin' to find
Where I've been
<♪>
Oh pilot of the storm
who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Who hid the path that
led me to that place
Of yellow desert screen
My shangri-la beneath the
summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats
high in June
When movin' through Kashmir
<♪>
Oh father of the four winds
fill my sails
'Cross the sea of years
With no provision
but an open face
Along the straits of fear
Whoa-oh ah-oh
Whoa-ohhh oh
<♪>
Ohhh
Whoa
When I'm on
When I'm on my way yeah
When I see
When I see the way
You stayyyyy-yeah
<♪>
Ooh-ooh yeah-yeah
Ooh-ooh yeah-yeah
When I'm downnn-yeah
Ooh-ooh yeah-yeah
Ooh-ooh yeah-yeah
When I'm down so down
Ooh my baby
Oooh my baby
let me take you there
Oh-oh
Come on come on
Oh
Let me take you there
Let me take you there
Ooh yeah-yeah
Ooh yeah-yeah
