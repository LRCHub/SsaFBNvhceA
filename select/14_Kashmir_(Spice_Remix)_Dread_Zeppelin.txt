Whoa Let The Sun Beat Down Upon My Face
And Stars To Fill My Dream
I Am A Traveler Of Both Time And Space
To Be Where I Have Been
T' Sit With Elders Of The Gentle Race
This World Has Seldom Seen
Th' Talk Of Days For Which They Sit And Wait
All Will Be Revealed
Talk And Song From Tongues Of Lilting Grace
Whose Sounds Caress My Ear
But Not A Word I Heard Could I Relate
The Story Was Quite Clear
Whoahoh Whoawaoh
Oooh Oh Baby I Been Flyin'
Lord Yeah Mama There Ain't No Denyin'
Oh Oooh Yes I've Been Flying
Mama Mama Ain't No Denyin' No Denyin'
Oh All I See Turns To Brown
As The Sun Burns The Ground
And My Eyes Fill With Sand
As I Scan This Wasted Land
Tryin' To Find Tryin' To Find Where I Beeeeeuhoaoh
Oh Pilot Of The Storm Who Leaves No Trace
Like Thoughts Inside A Dream
Heed The Path That Led Me To That Place
Yellow Desert Stream
My Shangrila Beneath The Summer Moon
Will Return Again
Sure As The Dust That Floats B'hind You
When Movin' Through Kashmir
Oh Father Of The Four Winds Fill My Sails
Across The Sea Of Years
With No Provision But An Open Face
'Long The Straits Of Fear
Whaoh Whaoh
Whaohoh Oh
Ohhhh
Well When I Want When I'm On My Way Yeah
When I See When I See The Way You Stayyeah
Ooh Yeahyeah Ooh Yeahyeah Well I'm Down Yes
Ooh Yeahyeah Ooh Yeahyeah Well I'm Down So Down
Ooh My Baby Oooh My Baby Let Me Take You There
Oh Oh Come On Come On
Oh Let Me Take You There
Let Me Take You There
Whooooh Yeahyeah Whooooh Yeahyeah Let Me Take You
